# admin_bot

Run docker via terminal
'docker run -e TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN LOOK NAME'

Created a telegram bot with the following inline options:

1. Make someone in the chat admin

2. Ban/unban a person in a chat

3. Get chat statistics: how many people, how many admins

4. Force the bot to leave the chat

5. And also so that when a new user arrives in the chat, the bot asks him a question (of your choice)
